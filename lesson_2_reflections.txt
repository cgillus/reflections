What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository it creates an empty repository without any commits.
	You need to do this so that git will now to track files in this repository once they are committed for version control.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where I put files that I have been working on and are ready to commit to the repository.
	It allows me to see what files are being changed and to see if it makes logical sense to commit them.
