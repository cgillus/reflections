When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working with a group and other people would need to look at your work.  Or a situation where you would be using multiple machines or have to work in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In case there are any merge conflicts with local files, you would want to manually update your repository so that you make sure that your work doesn't get overwritten.
