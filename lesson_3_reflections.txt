When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working with a group and other people would need to look at your work.  Or a situation where you would be using multiple machines or have to work in different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In case there are any merge conflicts with local files, you would want to manually update your repository so that you make sure that your work doesn't get overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Clones are direct copies of a repository, when you make changes to this, it is reflected on the repository. 
	Branches are offshoots of a repository, they allow you to work on a side feature with effecting what every else is working on.  
	Forks are copies of someone else's repository that you do not have permission to edit, which allows you to make changes to code you want to work with.
